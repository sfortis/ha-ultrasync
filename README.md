Interlogix ZeroWire and Hills ComNav (NX-595E) UltraSync Security Panel for Integration for Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)

This is based on a [a Pull Request I created here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/42549) to implement [my version of a UltraSync security panel](https://github.com/caronc/ultrasync) into Home Assistant (HA).

Unfortunately it's taking a little bit of time to get merged due to the significant backlog the HA team already has to deal with. The request comes from [a thread within the HA Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/interlogix-ultrasync/51464) asking for it's support.

This repository simply prepares a custom component that one can use early while we wait.  The other advantage of this repository is that new things can be tried and tested before they are merged into Home Assistant.

## Installation

You can only be logged into the ComNav/ZeroWire hub with the same user *once*; a subsequent login with the same user logs out the other. Since this tool/software actively polls and maintains a login session to your Hub, it can prevent you from being able to log into at the same time elsewhere (via it's website).  **It is strongly recommended that you create a second user account on your Hub dedicated to just this service.**

### From HACS

1. Install HACS if you haven't already (see [installation guide](https://hacs.netlify.com/docs/installation/manual)).
1. Find and install **UltraSync** integration in HACS's "Integrations" tab.
1. Restart your Home Assistant.
1. Add "UltraSync" integration in Home Assistant's "**Configuration** -> **Integrations** tab.

### Manual

1. Download and unzip the [repo archive](https://github.com/caronc/ha-ultrasync/archive/master.zip). (You could also click "Download ZIP" after pressing the green button in the repo, alternatively, you could clone the repo from SSH add-on).
2. Copy contents of the archive/repo into your `/config` directory.
3. Restart your Home Assistant.
4. Add "UltraSync" integration in Home Assistant's "**Configuration** -> **Integrations** tab.

## Configuration

Go to the integrations page in your configuration and click on new **Integration** -> **UltraSync**.

**Note**: You can only be logged into the ZeroWire/UltraSync hub with the same user once; a subsequent login with the same user logs out the other. Since Home Assistant (HA) actively polls and maintains a login session to this Hub, it can prevent you from being able to log into at the same time elsewhere (via it's website). It is strongly recommended that you create a second user account on your Hub dedicated for just HA.

### Sensor

Sensors are dynamically generated on the fly.

Sensors follow the following naming convention: `{ultrasync_integration}_{sensor}`.  The `{ultrasync_integration}` refers to the name you called your integration when you set it up (the default is `Ultrasync` so it is referenced in it's slug form `ultrasync`):

- `ultrasync_area1state`: The Area 1 State
- `ultrasync_area2state`: The Area 2 State
- `ultrasync_areaXstate`: The Area X State

Zone sensors work the same way and only load what is detected:

- `ultrasync_zone1state`: The Zone 1 State
- `ultrasync_zone2state`: The Zone 2 State
- `ultrasync_zoneXstate`: The Zone X State

Output and history sensors also work the same way and only load what is detected:

- `ultrasync_output1state`: The Output 1 State
- `ultrasync_output2state`: The Output 2 State
- `ultrasync_outputXstate`: The Output X State
- `ultrasync_historyXstate`: The History State

The attributes read from the hub are associated with each Detected Zone, Area, History (by area) and Output; so you can rename them to something more appropriate if you feel the need.

There are several states each Zone and Area sensor can be at, but usually they will be one of the following: `Unknown`, `Ready`, `Not Ready`, `Armed Stay`, and `Armed Away`.  The `Unknown` state is assigned to sensors that are not reporting; they usually sit in the spots of the Areas you're not monitoring.

The state of Output sensors will ALWAYS remain `0` whether it has been turned on or off. This is normal, the Output sensor simply acts as an entity to activate the `switch` service.

The state of History sensors will be updated whenever the Area sensor changes, so generally will be either one of `Turn off` or `Turn on`.

### Alarm Control Panel

Each area on your panel also gets an alarm control panel entity, named `{ultrasync_integration}_{area name}` (for example `alarm_control_panel.ultrasync_area_1`). It works with Home Assistant's built-in alarm panel card, so no custom card or template is needed.

- **Arm Home** sets the area to Stay, **Arm Away** sets it to Away, and **Disarm** disarms it. Only that area is changed.
- The state follows the panel itself: `disarmed`, `armed_home`, `armed_away`, `arming` (exit delay), `pending` (entry delay) or `triggered` (fire, burglar, panic or medical alarm).
- No code is asked for; the PIN from the integration setup is used.

All of the sensors, events and services above keep working as before.

### Panel Faults

The integration reports the faults that the panel itself shows, such as a low battery on a wireless sensor or a mains failure.

- `binary_sensor.{ultrasync_integration}_problem` turns on when the panel reports any system fault or any zone needs attention. Its `faults` attribute lists each one, for example `MC KITCHEN: Low Battery` or `System: AC Fail`.
- `sensor.{ultrasync_integration}_system_faults` shows the system faults of the panel as text, or `No faults`. Its `faults` attribute holds them as a list.
- A zone gets a `Battery` or a `Tamper` binary sensor the first time the panel reports that condition on it, and keeps it from then on. The panel does not say which zones are wireless or have a tamper switch, so they are not created up front. They are diagnostic entities, so they appear on the zone's device page rather than on default dashboards.

Zone faults need an xGen, xGen8 or ZeroWire panel.

This fork ships its own copy of the `ultrasync` library in `custom_components/ultrasync/vendor`, taken from the `panel-faults` branch of `sfortis/ultrasync`. Home Assistant therefore installs nothing from PyPI or GitHub for this integration. After changing the library, run `scripts/vendor_ultrasync.sh <path to the ultrasync checkout>` to update the copy.

### Zone and Area Controls

On xGen8 panels each zone device also gets two switches, and the panel device gets switches and sensors for each area:

- `Bypass` bypasses the zone while it is on. It sends the same command as the `bypass` and `unbypass` services. These switches start disabled; enable the ones you want on the zone's device page. Zones that the panel does not allow to be bypassed get no switch.
- `Chime` makes the keypad chime when the zone opens. It is a configuration entity.
- The area `Chime` switch turns the chime of the whole area on or off.
- The area `Night Mode` binary sensor is on while the area is armed in night mode.
- The area `Walk Test` binary sensor is on while the panel runs a walk test. It is a diagnostic entity.

**Warning:** every Home Assistant user who can see these switches can bypass a zone. A bypassed zone does not trigger the alarm while the area is armed. Home Assistant exposes switches to voice assistants by default, so after enabling a Bypass switch, check that it is not exposed under Settings, Voice assistants, Expose.

### Siren

On xGen8 panels each area gets a siren entity, for example `siren.ultrasync_home_siren`:

- Turning it on starts the panel's siren (the non-fire sound).
- Turning it off silences the siren with the panel's mute command, not with a disarm.
- `siren.turn_on` accepts a `duration` in seconds, after which the siren is silenced again. Just before that, the panel is read again; if the area is in alarm or the panel can not be read, the siren is left sounding and stops after the panel's siren time. A real alarm that starts in the second between that read and the mute can still be silenced.
- The state comes from the panel bits that were set while the siren sounded after the start command.

The panel stops the siren by itself after its programmed siren time, even if Home Assistant never turns it off. Home Assistant does not expose sirens to voice assistants by default.

Two things were not confirmed on a panel when this was written. The mute command was only tried while the area was disarmed, so it is not known whether it leaves an armed area armed. The siren state was only seen after the start command, so it is not known whether a real alarm sets the same bits.

### Panel Event Log

On xGen8 panels, `event.{ultrasync_integration}_panel_event` fires for every new entry in the panel's alarm log. That log holds alarms, troubles such as a low panel battery or a mains failure, arm and disarm, cancels and bypasses. The panel's main log is not used, because Home Assistant's own logins fill it: the panel ends a session after 10 minutes, so the integration logs in again six times an hour. The log is read every 30 seconds, and at once when an area changes. The event type comes from the Contact ID code of the entry: `alarm`, `alarm_restore`, `trouble`, `trouble_restore`, `arm`, `disarm`, `bypass`, `bypass_restore` or `other`. The event data holds the panel's description, the Contact ID code, the zone, the area and the user, with their names.

Example automation that reports who disarmed the alarm:

```yaml
- alias: Report Disarm
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: event.ultrasync_panel_event
    # Without this, the last event is reported again when the entity comes
    # back from unavailable
    not_from:
      - unavailable
      - unknown
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: event.ultrasync_panel_event
      attribute: event_type
      state: disarm
  action:
    service: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes.description }} by {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.user_name }}"
```

### Event Automation

When an Zone or Sensor changes it's state an event usable for automation is triggered on the Home Assistant Bus.

Possible events are:

- `ultrasync_sensor_update`: The event includes the sensor no, name, and new status it changed to.
- `ultrasync_area_update`: The event includes the area no, name, and new status it changed to (if it did).

**Note**: Areas are sent periodic heartbeats with Interlogix devices in which case the state will not change at all.

Example automation to send a message via [Apprise](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/apprise/) on a sensor change in your home:

```yaml
- alias: House Movement
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: ultrasync_sensor_update
  action:
    service: notify.apprise
    data:
      title: "Sensor activated!"
      message: "{{trigger.event.data.name}} has new status {{trigger.event.data.status}}"
```

### Services

Available services:

- `stay`: Set alarm scene to Stay Mode
- `away`: Set alarm scene to Away Mode (fully activate Alarm)
- `medical`: Triggers the Alarm (Medical Alarm). ComNav panels only.
- `fire`: Triggers the Alarm (Fire Alarm). ComNav panels only.
- `panic`: Triggers the Alarm (Panic Alarm). ComNav panels only.
- `disarm`: Disarm the alarm
- `bypass`: Bypasses a specified Zone
- `switch`: Activates an Output Control entity

On xGen, xGen8 and ZeroWire panels the `medical`, `fire` and `panic` services return an error. Older versions of the `ultrasync` library sent a disarm to these panels instead.

As an example you may want to `arm` your alarm in `stay` mode each night and disarm it in the morning like so:

```yaml
# Alarm Activation
- alias: Activate Nightly Alarm
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "23:00:00"
  action:
    service: ultrasync.stay

# Alarm Deactivation
- alias: Disarm Nightly Alarm
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "06:00:00"
  action:
    service: ultrasync.disarm
```
To activate the `bypass` service, simply specify the Zone entity number and call the service like so:

``` yaml
# Bypasses Zone 1
- alias: Bypass Sliding Door
  action:
    service: ultrasync.bypass
    data:
      zone: 1
```

To activate the `switch` service, simply specify the Output entity number along with the desired state for the Output (0 for off, 1 for on) like so:

``` yaml
# Activates Output 1 to the on position
- alias: Open Garage Door relay
  action:
    service: ultrasync.switch
    data:
      output: 1
      state: 1
```


## UI

A card I use that I created and works quite well can be found in this repository as well called [`ultrasync_alarm.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caronc/ha-ultrasync/main/ultrasync_alarm.yaml) found at the root of this GitHub repository.  It requires that you additionally have the following resources already pre-added:

- **layout-card**: [Source](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card)
- **button-card**: [Source](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)

The `ultrasync_alarm.yaml` looks like this:

## Apple Homekit

If you are running Homekit in conjunction with Home Assistant via a Homekit Bridge and wish to integrate your Ultrasync panel (via this integration), you can achieve this using a combination of the Alarm Control Panel Template (Home Assistant integration) and some custom automations. This is detailed below.

### Alarm Control Panel Template

Update your Home Assistant Configuration.yaml file to include the below:

``` yaml
#Alarm Config to Allow Homekit Integration
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: manual
    name: ultrasync_alarm_ghost
    code_arm_required: false
    arming_time: 0
    delay_time: 0
    trigger_time: 300
    disarmed:
      trigger_time: 0
    armed_away:
      arming_time: 30
      delay_time: 20
    armed_home:
      arming_time: 15
      delay_time: 10
  - platform: template
    panels:
      ultrasync_alarm:
        value_template: "{{ states('alarm_control_panel.ultrasync_alarm_ghost') }}"
        code_arm_required: false
        arm_away:
          service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away
          target:
            entity_id: alarm_control_panel.ultrasync_alarm_ghost
        arm_home:
          service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_home
          target:
            entity_id: alarm_control_panel.ultrasync_alarm_ghost
        disarm:
          service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_disarm
          target:
            entity_id: alarm_control_panel.ultrasync_alarm_ghost
```

### Automations

Create the following six automations to handle arming/disarming the panel from the Home app, as well as to ensure the status of the panel is consistent in the app when it is armed/disarmed from elsewhere.

``` yaml
